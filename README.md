# CallBoard

Service operations platform for equipment distributors — PMs, service tickets, itemized estimates, leads, parts orders, and tech KPIs. Integrates with Synergy ERP.

> **Name history:** Launched March 2026 as "PM Scheduler" (replacing EasyBee). Briefly renamed to "WrenchDesk" on 2026-04-24, then renamed again to "CallBoard" the same day after discovering the WrenchDesk name was already in use by another SaaS vendor. Both legacy GitHub / Vercel URLs continue to redirect.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend / Backend:** Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — hosted, with auth and row-level security
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Nightly Sync:** Python 3.9+ script (runs on workstation via Windows Task Scheduler)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+ (for nightly sync script)
- A Supabase account — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- Access to the Synergy workstation with the `ERPlinked` ODBC DSN configured (for sync script only)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd callboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a Supabase project

Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a new project, and wait for it to provision.

### 4. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and keys. Find these in your Supabase project under **Settings → API**.

### 5. Apply database migrations

Go to your Supabase project → **SQL Editor**, and run each migration file in order:

1. `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/003_indexes.sql`

For development, you can also run the seed data:

4. `supabase/seed.sql` — see the file header for important notes about user Auth account setup

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Sync Script Setup

The nightly Synergy sync script pulls customer, contact, and product data from Synergy ERP into Supabase.

See Phase 4 of the implementation plan — the sync script and its README are built in a later phase.

## Development Workflow

| Branch | Purpose | Vercel behavior |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `master` | Production | Auto-deploys to live site |
| `dev` | Development / testing | Auto-deploys to a preview URL |

1. All new work happens on `dev` (or feature branches off `dev`)
2. Push to `dev` → Vercel builds a preview deployment at a unique URL
3. Test the preview URL — it hits the same production database
4. When satisfied, merge `dev` → `master` via PR
5. Merge triggers production deployment

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import the GitHub repo.
3. In the Vercel project settings, add the following environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

> ⚠️ **Security note:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses Row Level Security entirely.
> It is only used in server-side API routes and the nightly sync script. Never expose it
> in client-side code or as a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.

4. Deploy. Vercel handles builds and deploys automatically on every push to `master`.
